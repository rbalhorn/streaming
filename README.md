## HLSjs-player

An HLS.js player created from scratch with custom controls.
Not completed.

Known Issues:
Can only load one player on a page at a time (mostly fixed)

TODO:
Quality Switcher still broken.  Needs to fix to UL LI elements and created like the captions section
remove ids from controls so that multiple videos can be loaded with working controls (mostly done)
look into BufferStallErrors (more likely Akamai universal stream packaging related - mostly fixed)
Look into loading as Classes (? - since its all event driven, we probably wont get much milage from this)
