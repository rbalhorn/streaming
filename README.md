## HLSjs-player

An HLS.js player created from scratch with custom controls.
Not completed.

Known Issues:
Can only load one player on a page at a time (mostly fixed)

TODO:
create audio and caption switcher controls for player
remove ids from controls so that multiple videos can be loaded with working controls (mostly done)
look into BufferStallErrors (more likely Akamai universal stream packaging related - mostly fixed)
