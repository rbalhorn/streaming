## HLSjs-player

An HLS.js player created from scratch with custom controls.
Not completed.

Known Issues:
Can only load one player on a page at a time
Clicking on buttons will cause the page to scroll sometimes

TODO:
prevent default clicks on buttons
create quality switcher controls for player
remove ids from controls so that multiple videos can be loaded with working controls
look into BufferStallErrors (more likely Akamai related)
